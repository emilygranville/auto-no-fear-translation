### Checkpoints in the transformer:
Code incorporated from the checkpointing code from Vassar CMPU 366 Assignment 5, which was adapted from an assignment developed by Carolyn Anderson, Wellesley College.

### Adding pretrained embeddings to the transformer:
Professor Gordon, Computer Science Professor at Vassar College.
